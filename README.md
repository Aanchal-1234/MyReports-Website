<h2>About the projects</h2>
  1. “My records” project built during Microsoft Engage 2022  program.<br>
  2. It is a website in which users can store all their medical documents including reports and prescriptions for future reference and access them from anywhere and any device.<br>
  3. Uses face recognition to login to the account.<br>

### **Salient Features**
  1. Users can login using face recognition.
  2. This website can be helpful when a person is in a critical condition and needs immediate treatment. Doctors can view the whole medical history of the patient just by scanning his/her face (even if his family is not there) and provide a complete treatment at an early stage.
  3. Users can upload their documents and view them whenever they want. No need to carry all those prescriptions and reports and even if anything gets misplaced, they will have a backup.

### **Compatible Platforms**
Laptops and Desktops

### **Built With**
Front-end - HTML, CSS, Javascript<br>
Back-end - Python<br>
Frame-work - Django<br>

<h2>Agile Methodology</h2>

### **What is Agile ?**
Agile is a development methodology adopted today in the software industry. Agile promotes teamwork, flexible procedures, and self-organizing teams.
### **How I Incorporated Agile Methodology During The Development Cycle**
SCRUM (Systematic Customer Resolution Unravelling Meeting) is a subset of Agile, a framework for developing software. SCRUM takes advantage of different techniques to achieve goals in Agile. SCRUM promotes an iterative model where the planning is performed on a very short term. The basic time working unit is the sprint. SCRUM teams always reason in sprints and their planning is limited to sprints.
<br><br>
**Sprint 1 (May 5): Sprint Planning, Research and Design** - Researching about various face recognition libraries and SDKs that can be used to make a facial recognition system. After finalising some related libraries for making the website, I searched for tutorials and other resources to design my website.
 
**Sprint 2 (May 12): Front-end Development** - Designed a wireframe including the functionalities I want and designed the UI. Started the front-end development process by taking help from YouTube tutorials. Built a website using HTML, CSS and javascript for the first time. 
 
**Sprint 3 (May 19): Back-end Development and debugging** - Started the backend development using python. Encountered occasional bugs which I debugged timely. 
 
**Sprint 4 (May 26): Debugging and finalising the project** - Integrated the whole project, made the required changes to make it more presentable and finalised the project.
